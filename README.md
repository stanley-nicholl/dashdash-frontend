# DashDash (Client)
> User can create a nested set of timers to keep them on track during a task, such as getting ready to go to work. So, rather than a simple wake-up timer, this app will invoke a series of timered steps to keep the user on track: wake up, finish showering, finish breakfast, out the door, etc.
> This is the client.

The DashDash client uses JavaScript with React and React Router to present a mobile-first experience for the user (designed for mobile screen aspect ratios).

## Installation
